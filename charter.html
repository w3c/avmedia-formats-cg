      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      Over the past decade, a growing number of sound and imaging media formats
      have been established offering increasingly sophisticated user experiences
      such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Spatial Audio. On the imaging side,
      these media formats provide the technical means to facilitate increased
      spatial and temporal resolutions, higher bit depths, as well as varying
      color volumes and the mapping between them. Similarly, on the audio side,
      higher bit-depth, sample rates and more immersive surround sound and speech
      processing options are available. These experiences are facilitated through
      tools and technical mechanisms available to both professional and consumer
      content providers and are readily available for temporally linear content
      types. However, options to provide such experiences through the web are
      still limited as potential solutions are fragmented and often insular or
      significantly limited in capabilities among open source as well as
      commercial options. This typically results in incorrect presentation to
      an end user or even error messages. Therefore, there is a need to consider
      how to support modern audiovisual formats in web browsers. To alleviate
      friction in development and deployment, it seems highly beneficial to our
      community to synchronize open and commercial solutions so that they can
      co-exist within a W3C framework.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope-of-work">
      Scope of Work
    </h2>
    <p>
      The scope of this community group is to provide a forum to discuss features
      of open and commercial audio-visual media formats that are relevant with
      web technologies used in browsers, TVs, and Smart TVs. In particular, this
      includes identifying and reporting if and how individual formats and their
      features are referenced, can be called from a web environment and query
      necessary information from a host system in meaningful ways. The interplay
      and synchronization among different formats is also considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      These assessments include developments in adjacent fields like broadcast,
      OTT, gaming and film-industry. This wide scope field is intended to identify
      immediate challenges influencing audio-visual web technologies that are not
      sufficiently covered by the active roadmap of other W3C groups. This
      includes current challenges as well as topics of mid-term relevance and
      future trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      This group will liaise with other W3C Working Groups and Interest Groups
      to promote the features and requirements that it identifies.
    </p>
    <h3 id="out-of-scope">
      Out of Scope
    </h3>
    <p>
      The technical development of standards is not in scope for the Community
      Group. Standards development is expected to take place within the
      appropriate W3C groups if such a group exists, or within a dedicated
      Community Group when incubation is needed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="deliverables">
      Deliverables
    </h2>
    <p>
      For current challenges, the group identifies changes beneficial to
      existing web APIs needed to support open and commercial sound and imaging
      media formats. In addition, relevant trends and developments will be
      reported. These observations will be raised in the relevant issue tracker
      for those specifications and, when appropriate, provided as one or more
      reports identifying challenges and opportunities to other W3C groups.
    </p>
    <h3 id="specifications">
      Specifications
    </h3>
    <p>
      No Specifications will be produced under the current charter.
    </p>
    <h3 id="non-normative-reports">
      Non-Normative Reports

    <p>
      The group may produce other Community Group Reports within the scope of
      this charter but that are not Specifications, for instance requirements
      for new APIs, or future looking "technology landscape" overview reports.
    </p>
    <h3 id="test-suites">

      The group operates under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/">Community and Business
      Group Process</a>. Terms in this Charter that conflict with those of the
      Community and Business Group Process are void.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with other Community Groups, W3C seeks organizational licensing
      commitments under the <a href=
      'http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/'>W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. When people request to
      participate without representing their organization's legal interests,
      W3C will in general approve those requests for this group with the
      following understanding: W3C will seek and expect an organizational
      commitment under the CLA starting with the individual's first request to
      make a contribution to a group <a href="#deliverables">Deliverable</a>.
      The section on <a href="#contrib">Contribution Mechanics</a> describes
      how W3C expects to monitor these contribution requests.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of
      Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> applies to participation in
      this group.
    </p>

    <h2 id="worklimit">

    <p>
      The group will not publish Specifications on topics other than those
      listed under <a href="#specifications">Specifications</a> above. See
      below for <a href="#charter-change">how to modify the charter</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="contrib">
      Contribution Mechanics
    </h2>
    <p>
      Substantive Contributions to Specifications can only be made by Community
      Group Participants who have agreed to the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications created in the Community Group must use the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document">
      W3C Software and Document License</a>. All other documents produced by
      the group should use that License where possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group participants agree to make all contributions in the
      GitHub repo the group is using for the particular document. This may be
      in the form of a pull request, by raising an issue, or by
      adding a comment to an existing issue.
    </p>
    <p id="githublicense">
      All GitHub repositories attached to the Community Group must contain a
      copy of the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/licenses/blob/master/CG-CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING</a>

      files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="transparency">
      Transparency
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group will conduct all of its technical work in public. All technical
      work will occur in the group's GitHub repository in preference to
      mailing list discussions. This is to ensure contributions can be tracked
      through a software tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants, but a public
      summary or minutes must be posted to the group's public mailing list or
      to the group's GitHub repository.
    </p>
    <h2 id="decision">
      Decision Process
    </h2>
    <p>
      This group will seek to make decisions through consensus. Typically, a
      document editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is
      then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers,
      and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required. After
      discussion and due consideration of different opinions, a decision should
      be publicly recorded (where GitHub is used as the resolution of an Issue).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is
      not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented,
      the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any
      objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any decisions reached at any meeting are tentative and should be recorded
      in a GitHub issue. Any group participant may object to a decision reached
      at an online or in-person meeting within 7 days of publication of the
      decision provided that they include clear technical reasons for their
      objection. The Chairs will facilitate discussion to try to resolve the
      objection according to the <a href="#decision">decision process</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Chairs' responsibility to ensure that the decision process is
      fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favour
      or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="chairs">
      Chair Selection
    </h2>
    <p>
      Participants in this group choose their Chair(s) and can replace their
      Chair(s) at any time using whatever means they prefer. However, if 5
      participants, no two from the same organisation, call for an election,
      the group must use the following process to replace any current Chair(s)
      with a new Chair, consulting the Community Development Lead on election
      operations (e.g., voting infrastructure and using <a href=
      "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2777">RFC 2777</a>).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Participants announce their candidacies. Participants have 14 days to
      announce their candidacies, but this period ends as soon as all
      participants have announced their intentions. If there is only one
      candidate, that person becomes the Chair. If there are two or more
      candidates, there is a vote. Otherwise, nothing changes.
      </li>
      <li>Participants vote. Participants have 21 days to vote for a single
      candidate, but this period ends as soon as all participants have voted.
      The individual who receives the most votes, no two from the same
      organisation, is elected chair. In case of a tie, RFC2777 is used to
      break the tie. An elected Chair may appoint co-Chairs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Participants dissatisfied with the outcome of an election may ask the
      Community Development Lead to intervene. The Community Development Lead,
      after evaluating the election, may take any action including no action.
    </p>
    <h2 id="charter-change">
      Amendments to this Charter
    </h2>
    <p>
      The group can decide to work on a proposed amended charter, editing the
      text using the <a href="#decision">Decision Process</a> described above.
      The decision on whether to adopt the amended charter is made by
      conducting a 30-day vote on the proposed new charter. The new charter, if
      approved, takes effect on either the proposed date in the charter itself,
      or 7 days after the result of the election is announced, whichever is
      later. A new charter must receive 2/3 of the votes cast in the approval
      vote to pass. The group may make simple corrections to the charter such
      as deliverable dates by the simpler group decision process rather than
      this charter amendment process. The group will use the amendment process
      for any substantive changes to the goals, scope, deliverables, decision
      process or rules for amending the charter.
